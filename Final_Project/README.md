# Final Project (Wine Quality Predictor)

## 1. Introduction

**1.1) Problem Statement**
Predict the quality of wine based on chemical properties.

**1.2) Use Cases**
The machine learn algorithm can help wineries during the maturity process of the wine to balance certain chemicals in order to improve the wine quality. 

**1.3) Exclusions** 
There are other features important to consider when producing wine that are not contemplated on this study such season weather, soil conditions, harvest date, aging, grape type, etc. 

**1.4) Data Set**
I have two data sets from Red/White wines each containing the chemical laboratory quantification and the respective overall quality (assessed by wine experts) for respectively 1599 (Red) and 4898 (White) different wines.

The data sets contain the following information:

|Property|Description|
|--|--|
|Fixed Acidity |Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).|
|Volatile Acidity|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
|Citric Acidity|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
|Residual Sugar|The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
|Chlorides|The Amount of salt in the wine.
|Free Sulfur Dioxide|The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents |microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.
|Total Sulfur Dioxide|Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 |concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
|Density|The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.
|pH|How acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.
|Sulphates|A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
|Alcohol|The percent alcohol content of the wine.
|Quality|The overall quality of the wine classified by a wine expert.

**1.4) Original Idea**
The original idea for this project came from the [Analytics Vidhya blog](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/) with ideas for Machine Learning Projects.
